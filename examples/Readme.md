# Examples

This folder contains several examples to profile with Darshan.
Look in the folder for instructions on how to run the examples and a list of questions to answer. 

# Profiling with Darshan

Load darshan and check in which folder the logs have been saved. 

```bash
module use /work/z19/shared/lparisi/courses/io/modules
module load darshan/3.4.6
```

Darshan is configured so that logs are saved in the folder defined in  `$DARSHAN_LOG_DIR_PATH`.

You can check which directories darshan look into when saving logs with the command `darshan-config --log-path`.

### Summary reports
You can generate a summary report using the `darshan-parser` command. For instance

```bash
darshan-parser $DARSHAN_LOG_DIR_PATH/lparisi_benchio_id7999586-88755_11-8-32949-14036386306537802543_1.darshan | less
```

### Traces 
Trace data is not collected by default. The feature needs to be enabled before submitting the simulation by setting an environment variable.

```bash
export DXT_ENABLE_IO_TRACE=1
```

You can generate a trace  by using the `darshan-dxt-parser` command. 

```bash
darshan-dxt-parser $DARSHAN_LOG_DIR_PATH/lparisi_benchio_id7999586-88755_11-8-32949-14036386306537802543_1.darshan | less
```

## Profiling with hpctoolkit

First you will need to install hpctoolkit

```bash
module load other-software
module load spack
spack install hpctoolkit%gcc
```

When running you will need to load `hpc-toolkit` from spack and then run prepeing the command hpc-run to the executable. The `-o` option can be specifying the output directory with the collected data.

```bash
module load other-software
module load spack
spack load hpctoolkit
module load PrgEnv-gnu

< ... >

srun --distribution=block:block --hint=nomultithread hpcrun -o my_executable_measurements my_executable

```

This will create a directory in folder. You will need to  tell hpctoolkit to analise the binary. This can be done by running `hpcstruct` on the measurement directory. For istance

```bash
hpstruct my_executable_measurements
```

This might take a while. But only needs to be done once on the first run.
You then need to generate a profile with 

```bash
hpcprof my_executable_measurements -o my_executable_database
```

You can view the results by using the hpcviewer tool and opening the database just generated.

```bash
hpcviewer
```

It can be very slow on the login nodes so I suggest installing hpcviewer on your local machine.

You can download the software at [https://hpctoolkit.org/download.html](https://hpctoolkit.org/download.html).
