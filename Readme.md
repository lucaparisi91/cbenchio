# I/O Benchmarking tutorial

Goal is to profile several codes of increasing complexity.
Some material on using Darshan on Archer2 should be produced.

- Collective vs Non collective IO
- Collective vs Non collective IO
- Performance tuning with HDF5

Might make sense to take a code and optimize it.
